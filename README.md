# pokerHands


I have created a Java Spring Server of pokerHands Evaluation of 5 cards on each hand.

I have also implemented a POST API which takes a JSON form of Poker Hands and returns the winner of a table.

I have had a Hand and a Card class which i use to evaluate pokers in hands, and each single method has a correspond test case. It helps me to check what went wrong during the proccess.
